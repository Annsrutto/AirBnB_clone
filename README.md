Description
This project is a part of the AirBnB clone series - a comprehensive approach to cloning the functionality of the AirBnB application. The goal is to cover the fundamentals of building a web application: the console, HTML, database management, API, front-end integration, and more. This README focuses on the command interpreter module of the project.

Command Interpreter
What is it?
The command interpreter is the part of the AirBnB clone that is used to manage the objects of our project:
    -Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    -Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
    -Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
    -Update attributes of an object
    -Destroy an object

How to start it
To start the command interpreter, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
    ./console.py
This will start the interpreter in interactive mode. You can also use it in non-interactive mode by piping echo commands into it, like so:
    echo "help" | ./console.py


Here's a template for a README.md for your AirBnB clone project, focusing on the command interpreter part of the project:

    echo "help" | ./console.py

How to use it
Once the interpreter has started, you can use various commands to interact with the AirBnB clone project. The basic syntax of these commands follows:
    <command> <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"

command: The action you want to perform (e.g., create, show, destroy, update, all).
class name: The type of object (e.g., User, Place).
id: The ID of the object (if applicable).
attribute name: The attribute you want to modify (if applicable).
attribute value: The new value of the attribute (if applicable).

Examples
Creating a new User:
    create User
Retrieving all User objects:
    all User
Updating a User's attribute:
    update User <user_id> email "user@example.com"
Exiting the interpreter:
    quit
